What does Narralyzer do?

Narralyzer will help you quickly analyze the occurrence of and relations between Entities in narrative texts, such as novels, short stories and newspaper articles in four languages. The following aspects of narrative texts are included in the analysis:

    NER (Named Entity Recognition)
    Relations between Entities
    Entity-text detection (aura of n = x)

Based on the NER and relation-analysis:

    A visualization (using GraphViz, see www.graphviz.org) of the relations between Entities can be created, per text-part and for the entire text

    Entity-text, per text-part and for the entire text, can be downloaded, so the user can then use it as material for performing more computational analyzes

What does Narralyzer need from you?

In order for Narralyzer to run properly, the input text should meet the following requirements:
Texts should be in either:Dutch, English, German or Spanish (Due to available NER-models)
Texts should be in one of the following formats:

    TEI
    PDF
    Epub
    Plain text

Text-parts (i.e. chapters or other relevant structural text-parts) should be classified as such;
Narralyzer will explicitly ask you to do this.

Exception: when the text-format is PDF or Epub and provides metadata on text partitions, manual text cutting is not always needed.

Note: for optimal usage of Narralyzer manual partitioning is, for now, the most reliable option.
