Narralyzer will help you quickly analyze the occurrence of and relations between Entities in narrative texts, such as novels, short stories and newspaper articles in four languages. The following aspects of narrative texts are included in the analysis:

- NER (Named Entity Recognition)
- Relations between Entities
- Entity-text extraction (aura of n = 5)


The backend library also does POS tagging and sentiment analysis, however this is not exposed in the frontend.
